From Sasha:
•⁠ ⁠⁠Illustrated arrow and hand cursors
•⁠ ⁠⁠Font for headings?
•⁠ ⁠⁠Images to use in animated footer
•⁠ ⁠⁠Animated logo gif?
•⁠ ⁠⁠Could also be cool to have some illustrated icon buttons like a cross to close the lightbox and arrows to navigate to the next image. They would need to be SVGs though
•⁠ ⁠Think about if you want a hero component to go at the top of all/some pages
